<title>PhoneGap Build Maven Plugin</title>
</head>
<body>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>
		The service will by default use the Android default developer
		certificate to sign the artifact, so there is no need to configure the
		below until you wish to release your app. However, in order to build
		release-able binaries for Android you need a signing key (see <a
			href="https://build.phonegap.com/docs/android-signing">Android
			Signing</a>). The plugin will take care of uploading the keystore and
		then associating it with your application, but you need to configure
		the plugin with a few details first.
	</p>

	<h2>Creating a Self-Signed Key</h2>
	<p>
		Creating a self-signed key is easy and well documented in the <a
			href="http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/app-signing.html#cert">guide
			on Android Developers</a>. As documented on the <a
			href="https://build.phonegap.com/docs/android-signing">PhoneGap
			Build site</a>, you need to note down the alias, keystore password, key
		password and the location of your keystore.
	</p>

	<h2>Configuring the Plugin</h2>

	<p>Again, we re-use the server section of the settings file for
		storing the keystore details, as it has various advantages over
		specifing properties etc. (not least that the passwords/passphrases
		can be encrypted).</p>

	<p>A valid server configuration would look like -</p>

	<pre>&lt;server&gt;
	&lt;id&gt;android-developer-certificate&lt;/id&gt;
	&lt;privateKey&gt;${user.home}/android.keystore&lt;/privateKey&gt;
	&lt;passphrase&gt;superSecretKeystorePassword&lt;/passphrase&gt; 
	&lt;username&gt;alias_name&lt;/username&gt; 
	&lt;password&gt;superSecretKeyPassword&lt;/password&gt; 
&lt;/server&gt;</pre>

	<p>Following the same pattern as authentication, you must configure
		the plugin with the server id (this id can also be set in the POM as a
		property or configuration parameter) -</p>
	<pre>&lt;properties&gt;
	&lt;phonegap-build.android.server&gt;android-developer-certificate&lt;/phonegap-build.android.server&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;</pre>


	<p><b>Additionally you must also explicitly tell the plugin to sign
		the artifact</b> (by default the Android development certificate is used)
		-</p>
	<pre>&lt;properties&gt;
	&lt;phonegap-build.android.sign&gt;true&lt;/phonegap-build.android.sign&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;</pre>

	<p>It is possible to configure the above using properties but it is
		not recommended.</p>

	<h2>Configuring the Plugin for Distribution</h2>
	<p>
		The same <a href="signing-for-ios.html">distribution profile based
			certificate switch</a> can be used for Android as was used for iOS.

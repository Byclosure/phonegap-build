<title>PhoneGap Build Maven Plugin</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>
		In order to build iOS binaries during development and distribution the
		service requires a certificate and provisioning profile (see <a
			href="https://build.phonegap.com/docs/ios-builds">Building for
			iOS</a>). The plugin will take care of uploading the appropriate
		certificate and profile and then associating them with your
		application, but you need to configure the plugin with the locations
		of those files.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>N.B. the word profile is used to two distinct things on this
			page - a Maven build profile and an iOS provisioning profile.
			Hopefully it's clear by context which is being referred to. </i>
	</p>

	<h3>Developer Certificate</h3>

	<p>A developer certificate is a private signing key and should
		therefore be specified by each developer working on the project in
		their settings.xml. We re-use the server section of the settings file
		for this, as it has various advantages over specifing properties etc.
		(not least that the passwords/passphrases can be encrypted).</p>

	<p>A valid server configuration would look like -</p>

	<pre>&lt;server&gt;
	&lt;id&gt;ios-developer-certificate&lt;/id&gt;
	&lt;privateKey&gt;${user.home}/ios.p12&lt;/privateKey&gt;
	&lt;passphrase&gt;superSecretPassword&lt;/passphrase&gt; 
&lt;/server&gt;</pre>

	<p>Following the same pattern as authentication, you must configure
		the plugin with the server id (this id can also be set in the POM as a
		property or configuration parameter)-</p>
	<pre>&lt;properties&gt;
	&lt;phonegap-build.ios.server&gt;ios-developer-certificate&lt;/phonegap-build.ios.server&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;</pre>

	<p>It is possible to configure the above using properties but it is
		not recommended.</p>

	<h3>Development Provisioning Profile</h3>

	<p>The development provisioning profile is slightly different
		because it is intended to be shared between developers building apps
		under a common wildcard namespace. Therefore there are two approaches
		supported and which is best will depend on the number of apps under
		development.</p>

	<p>
		If you are building multiple apps then the best approach is to store
		the development provisioning profile in a maven zip artifact, so that
		it can be shared between multiple projects. Firstly <a
			href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-remote.html">deploy
			a zip (i.e. packaging=zip) artifact into your repository</a> containing
		the file in the root folder, the filename must match exactly -
	</p>

	<pre>ios.mobileprovision</pre>

	<p>Now add a provided dependency (so that it does not get compiled
		into the application) on the deployed artifact e.g. -</p>

	<pre>&lt;dependency&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;com.github.chrisprice&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;certificates&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;${currentStableVersion}&lt;/version&gt; 
	&lt;type&gt;zip&lt;/type&gt;
	&lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;</pre>

	<p>Finally configure the plugin to use that artifact by referencing
		the dependencies artifact co-ordinate -</p>
	<pre>&lt;configuration&gt;
	&lt;keys&gt;com.github.chrisprice:certificates&lt;/keys&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>


	<p>If you are building just a single application then it might be
		easier to include the development provisioning profile in the project.
		To do this place the mobileprovision file into the phonegap-build
		folder e.g. -</p>

	<pre>src/phonegap-build/development.mobileprovision</pre>

	<p>And set the following configuration property in the project
		pom.xml to point at that file e.g. -</p>

	<pre>&lt;configuration&gt;
	&lt;iOsMobileProvision&gt;src/phonegap-build/ios.mobileprovision&lt;/iOsMobileProvision&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>

	<p>N.B. it is also possible although not recomended (as the
		provisioning profile can include multiple developer certificates) to
		share the developer certificate in the same way by creating a zip with
		both files, again the filenames much match exactly -</p>

	<ul>
		<li>ios.p12 - Developer certificate</li>
		<li>ios.mobileprovision - Provisioning profile</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Distribution Certificate</h3>

	<p>
		The distribution certificate requires special handling as it is the
		secure signing key for getting your apps into the app store, so it
		should also be stored securely. It is intended that one machine is
		setup to securely host the certificate and distribution builds are
		done on that machine with the a distribution <a
			href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html">profile
			activated</a>.
	</p>

	<p>To set this up, configure the distribution certificate as a
		server in the settings.xml on the secure host as was done for the
		developer certificates, but under a new server alias and without
		specifying the property e.g. -</p>

	<pre>&lt;server&gt;
	&lt;id&gt;ios-distribution-certificate&lt;/id&gt;
	&lt;privateKey&gt;${user.home}/private-folder/distribution.p12&lt;/privateKey&gt;
	&lt;passphrase&gt;superDuperSecretPassword&lt;/passphrase&gt; 
&lt;/server&gt;</pre>

	<p>
		And set the following <a
			href="http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Profiles">profile
			dependent configuration property</a> in the settings.xml to point at the
		server id e.g. -
	</p>

	<pre>&lt;profiles&gt;
	&lt;profile&gt;
		&lt;id&gt;distribution&lt;/id&gt;
		&lt;activation&gt;
			&lt;activeByDefault&gt;false&lt;/activeByDefault&gt;
		&lt;/activation&gt;
		&lt;properties&gt;
			&lt;phonegap-build.ios.server&gt;ios-distribution-certificate&lt;/phonegap-build.ios.server&gt;
		&lt;/properties&gt;
	&lt;/profile&gt;
&lt;/profiles&gt;
</pre>
	<h3>Distribution Provisioning Profile</h3>

	<p>The distribution provisioning profile also requires special
		handling but as it is useless without the distribution certificate can
		be handled less securely. And as a distribution profile can not be
		shared between apps, it makes sense to store it alongside the project
		in the phonegap-build folder e.g. -</p>

	<pre>src/phonegap-build/distribution.mobileprovision</pre>

	<p>And set the following profile dependent configuration property
		in the project pom.xml to point at that file e.g. -</p>

	<pre>&lt;profiles&gt;
	&lt;profile&gt;
		&lt;id&gt;distribution&lt;/id&gt;
		&lt;activation&gt;
			&lt;activeByDefault&gt;false&lt;/activeByDefault&gt;
		&lt;/activation&gt;
		&lt;properties&gt;
			&lt;iOsMobileProvision&gt;src/phonegap-build/distribution.mobileprovision&lt;/iOsMobileProvision&gt;
		&lt;/properties&gt;
	&lt;/profile&gt;
&lt;/profiles&gt;
</pre>
